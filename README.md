Co-occurrence network analysis of Art's Pemphigus removal data.

30nov2014

Aiming to finish in May. 

Having this out sooner rather than later would be very nice. Any plans
to visit Flagstaff this winter?


I  think it needs to show the network structure of susceptible
genotypes (so exclude 1008 and 1020 and maybe 996) with and without
the aphid. I think using both years together would be best? 

I don't think it necessarily has to be for each genotype but could
possibly be a three panel figure showing a network figure for the
susc. trees with the aphid removed, and a network figure for the
susc. tree with the aphid present (i.e. control), so the reader could
see how and if that changes. 

Then, if it were not too much trouble, make one more of the network on
just the resistant trees (control) that would allow us to compare the
susceptible genotypes with the aphid removed to the normal resistant
genotypes. In other words, does the network of the susceptible trees
with the aphid removed look more like the network of a naturally
resistant tree? I know this may be tough, and may not look how we hope
it will look, but so be it. The figure we have now is good if the
legend is understood but it does not seem to have a lot of heuristic
value. 

Lastly, if you could add your thoughts to the network structure
section of the discussion that would be great.
