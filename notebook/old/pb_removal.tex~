\section{Methods and Results Explaination}

\begin{itemize}
\item Barplots show the distributions of total abundances across all
  genotypes and treatments.
  \subitem In all analyses, species with fewer than 5 individuals
  within any subset of the data (e.g., the control or excluded
  communities) were removed.
\item The two years were analyzed separately.
\item Control and excluded communities were analyzed separately.
\item Tables are from null model based co-occurrence analyses:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Data were converted to presence-absence
  \item 5000 "null" communities were generated by randomization of the
    observed community matrix.
  \item C-scores (one community-wide measure of co-occurrence) were
    calculated for both the observed and simulated matrices
  \item Standardized Effect Sizes (SES) were calculated to measure
    the deviation of the community from random with the SES =
    $\frac{cscore_{observed} - \mu{null}}{\sigma{null}}$. SES greater
    than zero indicate dispersive (or competitive) patterns while SES
    less than zero indicate aggregative patterns.
  \item P.lower and P.upper are the empirical p-values showing the
    probabilities of observing C-scores less than or
    greater,respectively, than the observed (i.e. non-null) C-score by
    chance alone.
  \item The network diagrams show significant co-occurrence patterns
    based also on presence-absence the converted data (Ara\'ujo et
    al. 2011\cite{araujo2011})
  \item Histograms show the distributions of the null C-scores with
    dashed, vertical lines showing the observed (i.e. non-null)
    C-scores.
  \end{itemize}
\item Take-Home: 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Arboreal arthropod communities show significant co-occurrence
    patterns, likely due to underlying genotypic variation in the
    foundation species, \textit{Populus angustifolia}
  \item Co-occurrence patterns differ in response to \textit{Pemphigus
  betae} exclusion
  \item The effect of \textit{P. betae} differs between years, with
    the first year primarily being differences in the species showing
    significant co-occurrence patterns and the second year showing
    aggregative co-occurrence patterns when \textit{P. betae} is not
    excluded and no overall patterns when it is excluded.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
